# Flatiron Store on Rails

We're going to build an e-commerce site! We're going to make an online store where users can browse items, put items in their carts, and buy items, which changes our inventory. Users can log in using Github. We're eventually going to integrate the Stripe API to handle payments, and then integrate Segment.io to analyze user events.

## First iteration

### Tasks:

1. Models and Associations
* Use the unit tests to guide your model associations

2. Functionality through class and instance methods
* Use the integration tests to guide functionality

3. Omniauth (Github)
* Use the integration tests
